# Image classification from the CIFAR-10 Dataset

> https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Introduction
This project uses Tensorflow to create a Convolutional Neural Network. 
The Covnet is based on:
- 2 convolutional layers including Max-Pooling functions.
- 3 fully connected layers with dropout features on the first two layers to make the network more robust.

The accuracy of this CNN is 64%: It will associate the right label to an image a little bit more than 50% of the time... 
We could do better.

Stay tuned and enjoy !
